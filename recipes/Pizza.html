    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened <br>wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients <br>(such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked <br>at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450ÂºF.</li>
        <li>Roll/stretch out the dough on a clean and well floured surface. If dough starts to get a little sticky sprinkle more flour.</li>
        <li>Using the back of a spoon spread the sauce evenly over the center of the pizza, leaving just a little crust space. Don't over sauce your pizza or it might get soggy, you may not use all your pizza sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese in a single layer covering the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add all your favorite toppings, but be cautious not to add too much so that it gets too heavy.</li>
        <li>Cook 10-12 minutes until the cheese on the pizza is melted and starting to turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove from oven. Transfer to a cutting board, let rest for at least one minute then cut it and enjoy! Repeat process for more pizzas!</li>
    </ol>
